#Question 1: Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

for i in range(0, 11):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)


#Question 2: Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

x = 1
while x < 11:
   if i % 2 != 0:
      print(x)
      x +=1
